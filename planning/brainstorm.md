# Final Project
### Team Members: Ryan Williams and Ryan MacEachern

## Initial Brainstorm

- Base functionality: Geoguessr, Wordle-style
  - SPA (React on the front, Express on the back)
  - user login
  - play with friends
  - leaderboards
  - add/follow friends
  - basic profile customization
  - true responsive design for mobile
- Stretch functionality: 
  - custom games, choose your own locations
  - hide-and-seek. friends can send each other challenges
  - difficulty settings, camera on and off.
  - difficulty is reflected in the points system.
  - threshholds for points based on distance.
  - achievements/badges system (streaks, knowledge of geography, culture)
  - can stretch and scale and main windows on mobile
  - can view a list of people following you

APIs
  - Google maps/streetview
  - Authentication (Auth 0. does this introduce unneccessary issues?)
  - Firebase? (back end)


### Ask A Mentor

- Is there any reason to use Firebase for constructing our back end?
- Auth 0 is unneccessarily complex?
- Stack recommendations.
- DB structure for users, locations, friends etc.
- Next.js?
- Mobile multi-page app AND desktop SPA?
- what kind of database do you recommend?
- should we store the user's total score in the users table? or make a big function that totals the score from all of that user's guesses?
- migration / ORM libraries for node (knex / prisma / sequelize)
- can we use the react-express boilerplate and just change the versions?
- Tailwind, maybe alongside scss?
