# Demo Presentation and User Journey

## Introduction
"Hi I'm Ryan..." and a one sentence background.

## Inspiration and Project Overview
SEEK is a daily geolocation game where users test their geography knowledge by guessing the location of unique, daily streetview images. Players can connect with their other players, compare scores and even create their own custom games to share with their friends.

### Tech Stack
SEEK is built using React on the front-end, Express on the back-end and a Postgres database.

## App Walkthrough

*"One of our biggest challenges was just taking the first steps in building this app. With some many places to go, we had to really stay focused on building out the essential, core features of the app before implementing any of our countless 'nice-to-have' features."*

### 2. Drawer menu
